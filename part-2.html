Yeah he absolutely sizes up his ability to fight someone first chance he gets, and Peter seems pathetically easy, he’s not gonna lie. 

Peter’s just relieved and hopes they’ll actually leave him <em>alone</em>. Maybe he can sneak out and figure out where the hell he is once they go to their other friend.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Yep, yep, yep! Akira Akutagawa coming at it with the truth!&quot; Tatsuko exclaims, now back to her normal wiggly self, it seems.

&quot;Well, let&#39;s hurry up and get over to the Capo before she starts making more fuss,&quot; Kodou sighs. Shuusaku seems to silently agree, though reluctantly, somehow.

Only when she&#39;s sure they&#39;re mostly gone does the second warm body noted earlier move out from her hiding place. Despite being seven feet tall, she was hidden pretty neatly behind one of the aisles, but now reveals herself and says, quietly, though in a heavy Russian accent: &quot;I believe they ae gone now.

Peter was kind of surprised when the other girl revealed herself. However, he did slip back into his body, rubbing his head and sitting up carefully.

Kodo watched everyone&#39;s quests to find their books, poking around some and half looking for his own, his eyebrows furrowed a bit in concentration.

Watching Kodo look at the books, Akira makes a quick deduction. &quot;Forgive me if this sounds inconsiderate or mean, but - are you able to read?&quot; She asks, her face also looking fairly apologetic. &quot;No need to take offense, I&#39;m well aware that it happens...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Akira doesn&#39;t flinch, not even at his first response, only gives a little grin. &quot;It&#39;s fine, I get it.

He seems to be new here, like us. This is my brother, Ivan Dostoevsky II, but everyone in the family calls him Vanya.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t mind you calling me that as well,&quot; Vanya says, reaching up to pet the cat around his neck. &quot;And this is Duchess. I hope you aren&#39;t allergic?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yeah, the Agency&#39;s not a big deal unless you make it a big deal, yep, yep, yep,&quot; Tatsuko confirms from where she&#39;s sitting on the floor. Despite the earlier conversation, the book she&#39;s reading isn&#39;t one of the special ones, but rather, a completely normal book.

&quot;What she means to say is that, well, ever since the Closing Argument, the Port Mafia doesn&#39;t intentionally get into confrontations with the Agency, and the Agency does the same for us,&quot; Akira says. &quot;Its not a <em>perfect</em> agreement, and sometimes guys from either side&#39;ll fuck up and we have no choice but to do something about it, but it&#39;s not nearly as bad as it used to be. Or so I&#39;ve heard.&quot;

&quot;Plus, this place isn&#39;t even Yokohama, so the stakes are even lower,&quot; Kodou adds.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Kodo listened curiously and nodded slowly “I guess that makes sense… and it’s kind of a relief too.” He admitted before laughing “Here’s to hoping I don’t go soft before I get home!” Then his joking attitude faltered some as he added, more to himself, “Mr. Mori wouldn’t like that….”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Anastasia stiffens. &quot;He&#39;s followed us even <em>here?</em>&quot; Aside from shock, her voice is also laced with fear... and a bit of anger.

&quot;Ah, you won&#39;t go soft,&quot; Akira promises. &quot;The Don has us training like we used to here, anyway. I think he knows more than he&#39;s letting on about all this.&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t he just say we could &quot;refer to him causally&quot; while we were here, since it&#39;s not like home, huh, huh, huh?&quot; Tatsuko asks, now laying on her back and reading upside-down.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, anyway,&quot; Kodou says specifically to the younger boy. &quot;You&#39;re with us now, the Cats from Hell. Maybe it didn&#39;t mean anything to your Mori back where you&#39;re from, but if he remembers any of this when you get back thanks to... whatever freaky shit goes on in here, then our influence alone&#39;ll protect you.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Kodo listened to them all curiously, admittedly needing a bit to process because that was a ~lot~.

&quot;The Cats from Hell, that&#39;s the group we&#39;re all in, yep, yep, yep,&quot; Tatsuko giggles. &quot;We get mistaken for the Black Lizard all the time! Only, Grandpa Hiro&#39;s group doesn&#39;t <em>only</em> specialize in assassination! We do!&quot;

&quot;Essentially,&quot; Fumiko&#39;s voice returns as she does from around the corner of one of the standing shelves, &quot;we&#39;re th&#39; top-ranking assassination-only squad in th&#39; whole organization. It ain&#39;t that Uncle Mori&#39;s ssssscared of us. Nah. We&#39;re jus&#39; respected enough t&#39; get a ssssay in things.&quot;

Kodo listened to them curiously, absolutely fascinated by the information. “That’s so cool!” He beamed, clearly in awe of that reputation. It’s official, he’s a fan now.

&quot;That said, you yourself are an ability user, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Vanya asks, tilting his head for emphasis, though notably not in Peter&#39;s direction. Duchess moves to Vanya&#39;s head, resting there comfortably and purring loudly.

Fumiko flushes a little at the compliment, Venus&#39; Looking Glass flowers blossoming all over her hair and around the exposed skin of her neck wildly with the flattery. She pulls the collar of her jacket tighter to hide them, though it&#39;s probably not making much of a difference. &quot;We&#39;re pretty tough,&quot; she mumbles.

&quot;That&#39;s putting it lightly,&quot; Kodou laughs. &quot;We&#39;re strong as hell! We wouldn&#39;t be without Capo Fumiko, though. She brought us all together, paired us up with someone to match our strengths and weaknesses with their own.&quot;

Kodo listened excitedly, his bouncing getting even more intense, holding his hands up in loose fists at his side, as if he was going to do excited flappy hands, but he didn’t. “That’s so cool!” He beamed

&quot;Ah... I learned from th&#39; best,&quot; Fumiko mumbles softly, gently twirling one of the flowers between her fingers.

&quot;And by the best,&quot; a new voice exclaims, jumping down apparently from one of the air vents near the ceiling, somehow landing perfectly on her feet, &quot;she means <em>me</em>!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure she means Papa, Makoto,&quot; a second newcomer sighs, but having come up the stairs and through the door like a normal person. &quot;Sorry about her. Who&#39;s the new guy?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was one of those who typically chose not to voluntarily use their abilities... however his still flares up when overwhelmed. Which is unfortunately often, for him.

Kodo did jump a bit at the sudden appearance of new people, back on edge for a bit. Though, it seems like these newcomers are friends with the others, so hopefully still &#39;safe&#39;. 

&quot;Kodo.&quot; He introduced, figuring it best to keep it simple for the moment. Makoto is the one who had his attention the most, because she seems... a little chaotic. Like he&#39;s one to talk.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Kodo? Huh, must get kinda confusing, eh, Ko-chan?&quot; Makoto purrs, playfully elbowing Kodou in the side.

He rolls his eyes in response. &quot;Sure thing, Toto-chan.&quot;

At the nickname, Makoto&#39;s face goes bright red, as though trying to match her eyes. &quot;Hey, hey! That nickname&#39;s for Akiyuki only, jackass!&quot; Despite her words, there seems to be no real anger behind them.

&quot;I&#39;ll say it since she&#39;s not: nice to meet you, Kodo,&quot; Hyakken says, extending a hand and offering it to the other boy. &quot;I&#39;m Hyakken Fukuzawa, Makoto is my somehow-older twin sister.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;It&#39;s the reason why Ironsides scarred her face, and blinded me,&quot; Vanya finishes. &quot;She refused to go along with his twisted plans, and use her abilities for his gain. And so he retaliated.&quot;

Hyakken nods, then rubs at the back of his head. &quot;Ah heh, yeah. We&#39;re his kids-&quot;

&quot;And Ougai Mori&#39;s too,&quot; Makoto cuts in once she&#39;s done whacking Kodou&#39;s arm repeatedly. &quot;Though, his married name is Ougai Fukuzawa, he still uses Mori for mafia business.&quot;

There&#39;s no real benefits to it, which in and of itself, is a benefit.&quot; He mused. 

&quot;Still... I&#39;m sorry that you had to go through that, because of something out of your control.&quot;

Kodo blinked as he processed, tilting his head a bit. &quot;But... Mr. Mori and President Fukuzawa are always fighting? I thought they hated each other...?&quot; He mumbled. He needs to stop questioning that. But at least Tachihara and Tanizaki didn&#39;t have that kind of rivalry, that he was aware of at least. 

Though the mention of more... &quot;How many siblings do you have? Did you grow up together?&quot; He asked, perking up immediately. He&#39;s always fascinated by families, don&#39;t mind him</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Vanya&#39;s face takes on a look of worry; he can clearly hear the distress in his older sister&#39;s voice, and reaches out to take her hand in his.

&quot;Hey, listen, you weren&#39;t the only one shocked by them being together,&quot; Makoto laughs, waving her hand. &quot;The whole thing, as I&#39;m told, was fucking <em>chaotic.</em> It&#39;s mainly thanks to big bro Junichi that the Detective Agency and Port Mafia aren&#39;t constantly at each other&#39;s throats.&quot;

&quot;Uh, well... Junichi&#39;s older, so he&#39;s one... and then the younger ones, not counting us, we&#39;ve got the Category-F Tornado Triplets, so that&#39;s four...&quot; Hyakken counts on his fingers, just to make sure, &quot;and the youngest pair of twins adds two more, so siblings not counting us? Six.&quot;

&quot;And, unfortunately, we all grew up together. Still live together, actually,&quot; Makoto adds, rolling her eyes dramatically. &quot;The younger ones are a buncha&#39; little shits. Always stealing my stuff.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Kodo&#39;s eyes were wide in awe, even doing excited little stompy feets. &quot;That&#39;s so cool!&quot; He laughed. He&#39;s absolutely one of those technically only kids who thinks having siblings would be super cool. Though he does get Tachihara and Gin. But that doesn&#39;t feel the same.

Truthfully, I do not even know if Ironsides will make a move in such unknown territory... he waited weeks, possibly months, while in Yokohama to attack, just so he could learn the lay of the land, so to speak. You may just be safe here for a while if we can just figure out how to go home...&quot;

At Kodo&#39;s last question, Makoto snickers, then bursts into full-blown laughter. &quot;Hah! No, Elise isn&#39;t our sister- not technically. She&#39;s more like an aunt? A cousin, maybe?&quot; She looks to Hyakken, as if for confirmation, but he just shrugs.

&quot;If Papa hasn&#39;t told you exactly who Elise is, I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t spill all the details just yet,&quot; Hyakken replies. &quot;What I can tell you, though, is that she&#39;s not his biological daughter. Truth be told, <em>we</em> don&#39;t even know the full scope of who or what she is.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s real fun though,&quot; Tatsuko pipes up from on one of the bookshelves now. &quot;She lets us do whatever whenever she&#39;s in charge of the office!&quot;

&quot;Which is almost never, after the last time Pops ran off in a hurry and left her &quot;in charge&quot; and half the house almost burned down,&quot; Makoto snickers.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It isn’t that he dislikes kids, or thinks of them as little kids, but they are notably younger than him and anyone a teen or younger tends to stress him out more than people his age.

Kodo was kind of confused, but very fascinated. “Ohhh that’s cool! She always seemed cool, but she’s always close to Mr. Mori so I haven’t talked to her much…” he admitted sheepishly.

&quot;But we more than understand your hesitance,&quot; Vanya adds.

&quot;Now we got th&#39; books, we&#39;re gonna go find our folks,&quot; Fumiko says authoritatively from near the stairs leading up to the area the bookshelves are on. &quot;Yer free t&#39; come or not, it don&#39;t matter. &#39;n I&#39;m sure yer capable of makin&#39; yer own decisions.

Oh how his brother would be having a heart attack right about now, knowing he&#39;s surrounded by so many supposedly dangerous teenagers...

&quot;And maybe, with an extra pair of skilled eyes, we&#39;ll figure out all the super-secrets of this place and get outta here for good!&quot; Tatsuko exclaims from Akira&#39;s arms once she stops trying to get away. &quot;Your eyes are skilled, right, Kodo?&quot;

Don&#39;t mind Kodo being a confused bean. &quot;I....guess? Can eyes be skilled?&quot; He asked, tilting his head. &quot;Mr. Hirotsu says that I notice a lot of stuff though... Tachihara usually says it&#39;s because I&#39;m short.&quot; He pouted.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Fumiko huffs from where she leans against the railing of the stairs. &quot;That&#39;s what I was askin&#39; anyway. I can us&#39;ly tell who&#39;s one of us pretty quick.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Just as the three of them are heading around to the stairs leading up to the other floor, Fumiko and company are heading down. That said, it&#39;s not Fumiko who recognizes her at first.

&quot;Anya!&quot; Makoto exclaims, skidding down the railing of the stairs on her feet, almost like a skateboarder without a board - though, if one looked closely, they&#39;d be able to see two wooden blades protruding from the bottom of her shoes. Fumiko &quot;<em>tsk</em>&quot;s and rolls her eyes, though that doesn&#39;t seem to stop Makoto at all as she runs up to the other girl. &quot;What&#39;re you doin&#39; here, lookin&#39; for books too?&quot;

&quot;Ah, not quite,&quot; she smiles apologetically, while Vanya goes from Anastasia&#39;s arm to Hyakken&#39;s once he taps the boy on the shoulder and offers him his arm in turn.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Kodo watched Makoto in awe as she went down, half tempted to try sliding down the railing... so he did. It took some focus, and careful balance, but he managed to sit on the railing and slide down, laughing as he did so. He&#39;s always wanted to try that but never had the chance!

Tatsuko, absolutely enamored by both Makoto and Kodo, decides to give the whole &quot;sliding down the rails&quot; thing a try! Unfortunately for her, she actually <em>does</em> fall on her face, but after laying there for a second, she hops up as if nothing happened.

Kodo was definitely kind of worried about Tatsuko face planting, even going over to double check she&#39;s okay. When she hopped up and acted like nothing happened, he just laughed and beamed &quot;Right?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Oh, don&#39;t tell me I frightened you <em>again</em>? And so easily, too! It must not take a lot to get you to pass out like you did earlier, does it?&quot;

His voice is sweet, but in the way poisoned honey is sweet. Underneath the veneer of politeness is the unspoken curiosity in Shuusaku&#39;s voice, which reflects his thought of <em>just how easy is it to rattle you, little man?</em>

Before Shuusaku can bother Peter any further, however, Fumiko grabs her sister by his collar and drags him back. &quot;A&#39;ight, tha&#39;s enough, leave &#39;im alone.&quot; Fumiko turns to Peter and frowns apologetically. &quot;Sorry &#39;bout my ssssister, he&#39;s uh - a <em>lot</em> of a jackass.&quot;

Tatsuko, meanwhile, gives Kodo a high-five. &quot;Hell yeah! We&#39;re hardcore! We should do parkour together sometime, nobody else in my family really does it with me &#39;cept for Daddy, but whenever he does, Dad yells at both of us, me &#39;cause he gets afraid I&#39;ll break something, and Daddy &#39;cause he says <em>you should know better than to enable her dangerous behavior Michizou, we can&#39;t afford to keep fixing you two if you break all your bones every week!</em> Seriously, he&#39;s no fun.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Even if those people are kids. 

He visibly relaxed though when Fumiko grabbed Shuusaku, letting out a shaky <em>attempt</em> at a laugh. &quot;I... I see....&quot; He mumbled, fidgeting with the buttons of his vest absently to try and get rid of his anxious energy at least somewhat. 

Kodo laughed happily and returned the high five, snickering and nodded. &quot;Yes! Parkour would be fun!&quot; He agreed, bouncing on the balls of his feet a little bit from sheer excitement. &quot;I just have to make sure that I do it when Mr. Hirotsu isn&#39;t around, he gets upset because he thinks I&#39;m gonna get hurt...&quot; He pouted.

But it&#39;s not <em>my</em> fault other people can&#39;t understand me. After all, I am God. There&#39;s only so much of my existence any mortal could ever comprehend!&quot;

Fumiko rolls her eyes at that, and from where they stand a few feet away, Anastasia and Vanya snicker when they hear Shuusaku&#39;s familiar decree.

Makoto also returns to Fumiko&#39;s side, and... it&#39;s quite easy to see just how massive Makoto truly is, when compared to Fumiko. Though both of them are similar in muscle tone (as in, they are fairly well-built, with well-defined muscles on their arms from boxing), Makoto is a towering 6&#39;4&quot;, whereas Fumiko stands a mere 5&#39;5&quot;. Even so, Makoto clearly regards Fumiko as her superior.

&quot;You were hanging out with Anastasia, right?&quot; Makoto asks Peter, leaning back nonchalantly on her heels. &quot;Cool. You can tag along with our little group if you feel like it, we were gonna go try to find our parents and anyone else we might recognize.&quot;

&quot;Yeaaaah, sounds like Grandpa Hiro,&quot; Tatsuko giggles. &quot;Pop Melville says it&#39;s his favorite pastime, yep yep yep! If he <em>didn&#39;t</em> have somebody to worry about, he&#39;d totally go crazy. <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest</em> crazy, y&#39;know?

At the question, he came out of his train of thought and nodded. &quot;I... haven&#39;t got a better place to go, and staying alone in this library is likely not a good idea....&quot; He agreed softly. 

Kodo laughed and nodded happily &quot;I&#39;d believe it! He worries too much sometimes, Tachihara jokes that he needs to watch his blood pressure.&quot; He snickered. Ah, quick friends.

He gets <em>real</em> violent <em>real</em> fast if anybody tries tellin&#39; &#39;im he&#39;s a liar or a fake.&quot; Her expression is very serious, and Makoto subtly nods in agreement from behind her, as if corroborating her statements.

Shuusaku is usually only annoying at best, but the moment one doubts his godhood... the levels of violence he becomes capable of are the very reasons why Mori himself refused to allow Shuusaku to join all those years ago.

&quot;Yeah, sticking to a tough group with numbers like ours is probably best for someone like you,&quot; Hyakken says matter-of-factly, leaning against a nearby bookshelf. In stark contrast to his twin, it&#39;s... <em>very</em> obvious which father Hyakken takes more after in appearance. Even the dark circles under his eyes seem inherited from Yukichi Fukuzawa himself, though they most certainly are not inherited and are rather the result of a nonexistant sleep schedule.

&quot;Yeah, you seem hella strong to me!&quot; Tatsuko agrees. &quot;Whaddaya think, Neko-chan?&quot; She turns to Kodou, who grins and nods at his name-sharing new friend.

&quot;Yeah. I mean, it&#39;s not like Don Mori makes it a habit to recruit people who can&#39;t hold their own, after all.&quot; He seems convinced enough that Kodo can take care of himself enough to keep up with their group, even if he&#39;s not totally convinced that the kid is on the <em>same</em> level as the assassins themselves.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He looked over to Hyakken, honestly not seeing the resemblance if only because he&#39;s probably never actually met Fukuzawa. He&#39;s mostly familiar with Kenji, Dazai, and Kunikida from the Agency, with a passing knowledge of the others. He just gave a nod to the agreement. &quot;I&#39;ve apparently found myself in a... very dangerous environment, and I am really not a combative person...&quot;

Clearly. Considering he passes out when spooked. 

Kodo honestly perked up some at the confidence, clearly needing the reassurance. Especially since he logically knows they&#39;re considerably stronger than him. Then again, since when does he listen to logic? He knows he&#39;s got a great ability, he&#39;s just got to find it&#39;s fullest potential.

Though most people would do it in an attempt to relax or unwind, it seems to be a nervous behavior for him. &quot;Again. No offense. I just happen to know what fighters are built like, and you&#39;re... not. Plus, you&#39;re not carrying any weapons. Clearly, someone who&#39;s not prepared for a fight - even when they&#39;re not expecting one - doesn&#39;t get in many of them.&quot;

His garnet-colored eyes narrow with a hint of danger behind them. &quot;Might wanna be more careful around here. We don&#39;t know what this world&#39;s got in store for us. Just because nothing dangerous has been found yet, doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t be. You can only trust yourself in the end, after all.&quot;

&quot;Eugh, wouldja&#39; chill out with the goddamn doom-and-gloom, Mister Emo?&quot; Makoto groans, rubbing at her forehead like listening to Hyakken has given her a headache (it hasn&#39;t, she&#39;s just dramatic, it seems to run in the family). &quot;Seriously, nobody wants to hear you wax poetic about life! Go find your <em>boyfriend</em> if you wanna do that shit.&quot;

Hyakken grits his teeth. &quot;Fiance.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not callin&#39; him that! He doesn&#39;t count, he asked you to marry him <em>once</em> when you two were sixteen and hasn&#39;t asked again!&quot;

&quot;Because I told him I didn&#39;t know yet, and not to ask again until I was ready, geez! Why d&#39;ya gotta argue with me about <em>everything</em>, asshat?!&quot;

Fumiko just stares at Peter apologetically as the twins devolve into yelling and angry hand gestures at each other; though, notably, neither attempts to actually attack the other one, despite their heated words.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He knows very well that the only potentially intimidating thing about him is his height, and considering how much he slouches, that&#39;s not much of a factor anymore. 

Though the argument that ensued didn&#39;t really help his anxiety, giving a tiny nod to Fumiko in recognition of her look. He absolutely found himself gravitating ever so slightly towards the calmer kids, such as Fumiko. 

&quot;He&#39;s not wrong that I should be careful, at least...&quot; He mumbled, more to himself than anything. Yeah he has no clue how to handle any of this, really.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She sighs a little with relief, happy to see her getting along with someone else who isn&#39;t her. &quot;But we should <em>all</em> be careful. Not just those who might be physically weaker, or less skilled. Especially if Ironsides and his crew made it here.&quot;

At the mention of his name, Anastasia shivers again, wrapping her arms around herself as though giving herself a hug. Vanya, too, looks displeased, though his expression is directed towards no one in particular. Duchess rubs against his cheek, mewing, and Vanya&#39;s expression quickly changes to a soft smile as he pets her.

&quot;Eh, we&#39;ll keep a lookout, but &#39;till he sssssshows his ugly mug, we&#39;ll be a&#39;ight. We gotta get our asses movin&#39; tho, &#39;fore our folks n&#39; other people lose their minds lookin&#39; for us,&quot; Fumiko sighs, making her way to the doors of the library.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He shook his head to dismiss the thought and focus on the moment. &quot;Well... I&#39;ll follow all of you.&quot; He said quietly, following the general hoard. 

Kodo just took to following Tatsuko, because new friend acquired! And he&#39;s very excited about it! Though he was absolutely fighting his urge to get out at least one knife to play with. But he doesn&#39;t want to intimidate anyone, especially Peter. He might pass back out and he doesn&#39;t wanna drag his ass however far.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
